# Automated Guided Vehicles
===========

#Summary 

An automated guided vehicle or automatic guided vehicle (AGV) is a mobile robot that follows markers or wires in the floor, or uses vision, magnets, or lasers for navigation. 

#Implementation

As we know that products in warehouse would be treated as a dense graph which can be traversed easily with single source shortest path algorithm (Dijakstra).
Complexity O(E+VlogV).

The implementation is based on paper provided above.
